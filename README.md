# OOP-Mastery-Build-Compose-Decorate-using-Python
This repository contains a complete, hands-on practice series to master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. From foundational topics like self and constructors to advanced features like decorators and abstract classes, each example is crafted to reinforce real-world OOP design and syntax.

🔧 What's Inside
Each assignment is self-contained and demonstrates a specific OOP concept. Below is a summary of what's included:

🔹 Basics & Object Construction
Using self

Create a Student class and initialize attributes using self.

Using cls

Count object instances using class variables and @classmethod.

Public Variables & Methods

Use public access with a Car class.

Class Variables & Class Methods

Use shared variables in a Bank class and update them via @classmethod.

Static Methods

Define utility methods with @staticmethod in MathUtils.

🏗️ Object Lifecycle & Access Control
Constructors and Destructors

Log messages on object creation and deletion in Logger.

Access Modifiers

Demonstrate public, protected, and private variables in Employee.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Inheritance & Polymorphism
Using super()

Inherit from Person in a Teacher class and call parent constructor.

Abstract Classes

Create an abstract Shape class and implement it in Rectangle.

Instance Methods

Add behavior via instance methods in a Dog class.

📚 Class-level Design Patterns
Class Methods

Track book count using a class variable in Book.

Static Methods

Convert temperature using static logic in TemperatureConverter.

🔄 Object Relationships
Composition

Use an Engine inside a Car object.

Aggregation

Associate a Department with an external Employee.

🧠 Inheritance Mechanics
MRO and Diamond Inheritance

Observe method resolution in multiple inheritance with D(B, C).

🎁 Decorators & Advanced Features
Function Decorators

Log function calls using log_function_call.

Class Decorators

Add a greet() method dynamically to Person.

Property Decorators

Use @property, @setter, and @deleter for _price in Product.

🧩 Special Methods & Exceptions
__call__() and callable()

Make objects callable in Multiplier.

Custom Exception

Raise and handle InvalidAgeError in check_age().

Custom Iterable

Implement a countdown using __iter__() and __next__().

Open the notebook in Google Colab:

Click on any of the links to the notebook, or use the Google Colab interface to open them.

Run each cell by pressing Shift + Enter or clicking the "Run" button in the notebook.
